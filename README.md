# HAB eXist-db OAI-PMH Interface

This is the
[OAI-PMH](https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html) Interface
for the [Manuscript Database](http://diglib.hab.de/?db=mss&lang=en) by
[Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenb√ºttel](http://www.hab.de/en/home.html). The 
interface is implemented as an eXist-db application. All versions can be
[downloaded here](https://github.com/wendig-ou/hab-oai-pmh/tree/master/dist).

# Deployment

Just upload the .xar file to your eXist-db package manager. See
[available versions](https://github.com/wendig-ou/hab-oai-pmh/tree/master/dist).

Configuration kann be changed in the package's `profiles.xml`. Either change the
default profile or copy it, choose a different name for it and change it. To
make the app use a non-default profile, the url parameter `profile=my-profile`
needs to be specified when making OAI PMH requests.

Special care has to be taken with data containing the `xml:base` attribute. The
attribute influences the way the app determines document locations and therefore
leads to problems. In most circumstances, it should be removed.

# Development

This repository ships with a [Vagrantfile](https://www.vagrantup.com/) so you may run

~~~bash
vagrant up
~~~

to get startet. The dataset used to develop this software is not
included and has to be installed afterwards, which is very simple: Given the
file mss.zip in /vagrant/mss.zip, do

~~~bash
vagrant ssh
cd /mnt
sudo /vagrant/bin/mount.sh # leave password empty when prompted

sudo unzip /vagrant/mss.zip
sudo cp -urv mss/ dav/ # this will take a lot of time
sudo rm -rf mss
sudo umount dav
~~~

At this point the data is available and the application can be used at
https://localhost:8080

# Tests

The application has been validated with
[the official OAI-PMH validator](https://www.openarchives.org/Register/ValidateSite)
and there is a number of local tests available as rspec tests. To run them,
install ruby, run `bundle install` and then `bundle exec rspec`.
